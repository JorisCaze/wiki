# Format USB key for printer

In case you want to use a USB key with a smart printer to save a scan on the key or to print a file from the key, you must format the key in a specific format. 
Otherwise, the key will not be recognize by the printer.

Since the printer is quite a dummy device, the best format for the USB key is **FAT32** also called FAT.

I tried several times with Xerox printer to use exFAT but with no success.
