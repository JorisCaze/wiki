# Auto reboot after power-failure

In case of a power-failure, it might be interesting to restart a server automatically. 
This can be controlled in the BIOS options.
When starting the server go to the BIOS by hitting **F2** or **F12**.
Then check the section *Power Management* -> *Reboot after power-failure* and set it to *Always On*.
